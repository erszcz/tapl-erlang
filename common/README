Contains modules useful across multiple TAPL implementations.

Run "make test" to test the modules.

To run a make operation on all implementations, compile and execute the run-make-all script (e.g., "make run-make-all && ./run-make-all --command=test --dir=../").  See RunMakeAll.hs for more details.
