# My TaPL solutions in Erlang

See https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/

See also `ocaml` and `haskell` branches of this repository:

- `ocaml` contains the original OCaml solutions available from
  [Benjamin C. Pierce's "Types and Programming Languages" site](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/);
  I ported some of them to use `Bytes` instead of `String`, so that they
  build and run fine with OCaml 4.11.1.

- `haskell` contains Ryan W. Porter's Haskell translations of the OCaml solutions
  which I mirrored from https://code.google.com/archive/p/tapl-haskell/

I'm just mirroring the code in this repo for convenience.
