The goal of this project is to create Haskell ports of the OCaml implementations of "Types and Programming Languages" (TAPL), by Benjamin C. Pierce.  For an overview, see:
 
http://code.google.com/p/tapl-haskell/

It depends on the Parsec and HUnit libraries, which must be separately installed on your system.  These implementations have only been tested using GHC on Ubuntu, with the above libraries installed.
  
To test the entire project, go to the "common" subdirectory and execute "make all-test".  Other global commands (e.g., code generation) are also launched from that directory.
